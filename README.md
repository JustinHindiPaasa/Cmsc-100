Key takeaways from this exercise:
Take patience on doing this project
Give your full effort especially on designing and
searching hovers
Check the best color pallets (Mine on facebook)
I feel this is not my best if I don't have backlogs
Divs are annoying but try to layout, I've been stuck like 2 hrs 
because of centering pictures
